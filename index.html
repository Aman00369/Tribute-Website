                <h2>The Industrialist of India</h2>
                <p><b>Ratan Tata</b> is one of India’s most respected industrialists and a symbol of ethical leadership.
                    Born
                    on 28 December 1937, he served as the Chairman of Tata Group from 1991 to 2012 and later as Chairman
                    Emeritus. Under his leadership, the Tata Group transformed from a largely India-focused company into
                    a global business empire. Major international acquisitions such as Tetley Tea, Corus Steel, and
                    Jaguar Land Rover brought global recognition to Indian industry.<br>

                    Ratan Tata is admired not only for his business vision but also for his humility, integrity, and
                    concern for society. He strongly believed that businesses should contribute to national development.
                    A large portion of Tata Group’s profits is used for education, healthcare, rural development, and
                    scientific research through Tata Trusts.<br>

                    He played a key role in launching innovative and affordable products like the Tata Nano, aimed at
                    making car ownership possible for middle-class families. Despite his success, Ratan Tata lives a
                    simple life and avoids publicity. He is often called **“The Gentleman of Indian Industry”** for his
                    values and compassion. His life inspires millions of young Indians to lead with honesty, purpose,
                    and responsibility.
